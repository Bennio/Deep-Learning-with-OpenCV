# Deep-Learning-with-OpenCV
Deep Learning is a fast growing domain of Machine Learning and if you’re working in the field of computer vision/image processing already (or getting up to speed), it’s a crucial area to explore.  With OpenCV 3.3, we can utilize pre-trained networks with popular deep learning frameworks. The fact that they are pre-trained implies that we don’t need to spend many hours training the network — rather we can complete a forward pass and utilize the output to make a decision within our application.  OpenCV does not (and does not intend to be) to be a tool for training networks — there are already great frameworks available for that purpose. Since a network (such as a CNN) can be used as a classifier, it makes logical sense that OpenCV has a Deep Learning module that we can leverage easily within the OpenCV ecosystem.  Popular network architectures compatible with OpenCV 3.3 include:  GoogleLeNet (used in this blog post) AlexNet SqueezeNet VGGNet (and associated flavors) ResNet
